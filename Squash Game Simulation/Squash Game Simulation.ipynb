    "The assumption is that English scoring will give more advantage to the player with higher ability. This should be shown by the higher probability of winning the game with the English scoring method. This is because in the English scoring method, whoever wins a rally will become a server and if the server scores, they will gain a point. Assuming that the better player has a higher chance of becoming a server and continuing throughout the game as a server, that player will also have a higher chance of winning the game."

    "Firstly, identify a clear and concise problem that needs to be investigated. Then, write all the functions that will create the simulation. After that, the simulations are repeated (100 times) and tested with 60 different combinations of the player's ability; therefore, the graph will become more reliable. From there, the conclusion can be written.\n",

    "LIMITATION\n",
    "- This function is based on generating a random number to simulate the game and can only input the estimation of the player's ability.\n",
    "- In the real world, the player's condition, environment, and other external variables also affect the game, but it is hard to put that into the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FUTURE EXTENSIONS\n",
    "- Input larger different combination of player's ability\n",
    "- Visualisation of the simulation can be used to help other people to understand the function \n",
    "- A way to take other external variables (environment, etc.) can be added into the function to have a more accurate prediction."
